## Dijkstra's Shortest Path

- Uses a heap to compute the shorest path from a chosen node to all other nodes in a graph by means of Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm. 

- You supply the graph (in the correct form of course: Dict{Any, Dict{Any, Number}}) and we'll supply the shortest paths.

- The file is thus: DijkstraShortestPath.ipynb
